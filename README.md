### Service Principals

There are 2 service principals: one each for staging and production.
They each have an OAuth token that was created in the Databricks portal that are used to authenticate the Github Action Runner to Databricks.
The OAuth token consists of a Secret, and it is stored in the assocated Github Environment as a secret.
The Service Principal's ID is also stored in the Github Environment as variable.
Here is a screenshot of the production environment setup in Github:

The OAuth key for the Databricks service principal prd_sp stored as environment variables DBX_SP_ID and DBX_SP_SECRET, respectively.
This holds across all three environments, and the names are as follows:

| Github Environment Name | Databricks Service Principal Name |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| stage                   | stage_sp                          |
| prod                    | prod_sp                           |

You can find the service principal by

1. Start at the homepage of the Databricks environment
